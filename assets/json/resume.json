During 2020 our company was able to deliver more ML than in the previous 4 years, totalling more than one hundred ML use cases. The number of teams doing ML increased by 60%, the time to build and deploy ML models was reduced by 15%, and hundreds of people were trained in ML.\n\nSome of the main initiatives of our area:\n(1) We improve Adevinta marketplaces with our ML models: from image recognition to recommender systems and NLP. The results of our models impact millions of users daily, helping them find what they are looking for, making the marketplaces safer, or reducing our costs and increasing our revenue.\n(2) We nurture an active internal ML community with hundreds of members to share learnings, best practices, tooling, use cases, etc.\n(3) We build tooling to make ML teams more effective, by working very close to the ML community. During 2020 we were able to build and deploy an ML platform to 80% of teams in Adevinta, providing them with new capabilities and reducing their time to build and deploy ML by 15%.\n(4) We increased the knowledge and adoption of ML with in house online trainings for both business and tech people: the ML academy. Hundreds of participants finished it, rating over 92%, and more than half of the participants identified new opportunities with ML in their business domain.",

We identify the set of unstable periodic orbits that constitute the fractal repeller that completely describes the chaotic escape dynamics of photons. In the framework of periodic orbit theory, the analysis of the linear stability of the unstable periodic orbits is used to obtain the main quantities of chaos that characterize the escape dynamics of the photons scattered by the black holes. In particular, the escape rate which is compared with the result obtained from numerical simulations that consider statistical ensembles of photons. We also analyze the dynamics of photons in the proximity of a perturbed black hole and give an analytical estimation for the escape rate in this system.",
