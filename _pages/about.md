I currently work as Engineering Director of Machine Learning at [Adevinta](www.adevinta.com) in Barcelona, with the mission of accelerating the AI transformation of our marketplaces.

I have also worked at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/) in London and at [Procter & Gamble](https://us.pg.com/) in Barcelona.

I studied Theoretical Physics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/theoretical-physics/) and in the [Universidad de La Laguna](https://www.ull.es/departamentos/fisica/).

I do many other things in my free time, like occasionally teaching machine learning in a few universities, [coding](https://github.com/manuelsh), a bit of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manuelsh), [writing](/blog), reading, etc. I am also lucky to be father of three kids.

I hope you find something interesting here. Was tempted to add a picture of my cat, but I don't have one.
